# ðŸ¤– AI Comment Tasks V2 - Individual File Processing

## THE MISSION
Add MEANINGFUL comment blocks to each code file by ACTUALLY READING and UNDERSTANDING what it does.

## THE PROCESS
Complete each numbered task below. For each task:
1. READ the actual file at the specified path
2. THINK about what it actually does (not just its name!)
3. WRITE a comment block that explains:
   - WHAT it does in plain English
   - WHY you need it (what breaks without it)
   - WHO uses it (what depends on it)
   - CRITICAL status (can you safely modify/delete it?)
4. UPDATE the file with the comment block
5. MOVE to the next task

## COMMENT TEMPLATE
