# Quick Recovery Notes - Feadship Project

## 🚀 Where We Left Off
Currently investigating why the world map isn't displaying in Operations1Page.

## 🔍 Current Investigation
```bash
# We were checking:
1. Map image exists: ✓ /public/assets/step4/Map.png
2. Z-index layering: ✓ Appears correct in WorldMap.tsx
3. Next to check: Parent container styling in Operations1Page
```

## 📝 Last Commands Run
```bash
npm run dev  # Development server should be running
npx tsc --noEmit  # TypeScript check passed ✓
```

## 🎯 Immediate Next Steps
1. Check Operations1Page container height/overflow
2. Inspect with browser DevTools - is map rendering but hidden?
3. Check if NavigationBar is overlapping map area

## 💡 Quick Test
Open browser to: http://localhost:5173/operations1
- Open DevTools (F12)
- Inspect the map container
- Check computed styles for height/overflow
- Look for z-index conflicts

## 🛠️ If Map Still Not Visible
```jsx
// Check these areas in Operations1Page.tsx:
// Line 87-122 - Container divs around ViewMap
// Look for: overflow-auto, h-full, flex-1
```

## ✅ What's Working
- All data persistence (Design, Operations, Paint, Features)
- New StandardFeatureCard component
- Navigation flow with NavigationBar

## ❌ What Needs Fixing
- Map visibility (current task)
- Color picker white color issue
- Custom color saving
- Summary page layout

Good luck with your restart! The development server will need to be restarted with `npm run dev`.
