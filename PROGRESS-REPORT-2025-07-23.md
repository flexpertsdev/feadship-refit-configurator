# Feadship Config Design Flow - Progress Report
## Date: 2025-07-23

## Summary
We've been systematically rebuilding the V2 data architecture, focusing on ensuring data persistence and fixing UI issues. Following a strategic "Foundation First, Then Polish" approach.

## Completed Tasks ✅

### Phase 1: Core Data Flow (COMPLETED)

#### 1. Design Page - Preferences Save Correctly ✅
- **Status**: Working correctly
- **Findings**: 
  - Already implements direct update pattern
  - Saves design levels to yacht config via `saveYachtData()`
  - Also saves as preferences for V2 system
  - Persists to localStorage correctly
- **Files**: `/src/pages/DesignPage.tsx`

#### 2. Operations Pages - WHO/WHAT/WHERE Selections ✅
- **Status**: All three pages working correctly

**Operations1Page (WHERE - Map Selection)**
- Fixed region ID conversion logic
- Updated `handleLocationChange` to properly sync region preferences
- Regions save as `region_mediterranean`, `region_caribbean`, etc.
- **Files**: `/src/pages/Operations1Page.tsx`

**Operations2Page (WHO - Private/Charter)**
- Already working correctly via `useOperationTypeSelection` hook
- Saves `operation_private` preference for Private selection
- Charter is default (no preference needed)
- **Files**: `/src/pages/Operations2Page.tsx`, `/src/hooks/useOperationTypeSelection.ts`

**Operations3Page (WHAT - Activities)**
- Updated `ActivityGridView` to implement direct update pattern
- Removed local state and batching
- Now calls `togglePreference()` immediately on activity click
- Activities save as `activity_diving`, `activity_fishing`, etc.
- **Files**: `/src/pages/Operations3Page.tsx`, `/src/components/operations/ActivityGridView.tsx`

#### 3. Paint Page - Color Selections Persist ✅
- **Status**: Working correctly
- **Findings**:
  - Uses `updateYachtColor()` which persists to yacht store
  - Has complex debouncing for pixel streaming performance
  - Handles special cases like bootstripe → boot_stripe_paint
- **Files**: `/src/pages/ConfiguratorPage.tsx`

#### 4. Features/Services/Sustainability - Selections Save ✅
- **Status**: All working correctly
- **Findings**:
  - All use `FeatureGridView` → `useFeatureSelection` → `toggleConfig()`
  - Direct update pattern already implemented
  - Reads from `currentYacht.configs`
  - Filters by category correctly
- **Files**: 
  - `/src/pages/FeaturesPage.tsx`
  - `/src/pages/ServicesPage.tsx`
  - `/src/pages/SustainabilityPage.tsx`
  - `/src/hooks/useFeatureSelection.ts`

### Phase 2: Critical UX Fixes (IN PROGRESS)

#### 1. Fix Card Displays ✅
- **Status**: COMPLETED
- **Actions Taken**:
  - Created new `StandardFeatureCard.tsx` with 400x300 ratio
  - 2/3 image area, 1/3 text area as per designer specs
  - Updated `FeatureGrid.tsx` to use new card component
  - Improved responsive grid layout (1-4 columns)
  - Added proper hover states and selected overlays
- **Files Created**: `/src/components/features/StandardFeatureCard.tsx`
- **Files Modified**: 
  - `/src/components/features/FeatureGrid.tsx`
  - `/src/components/features/FeatureGridView.tsx`
  - `/src/hooks/useFeatureSelection.ts`

#### 2. Restore Missing UI Elements 🔄
- **Status**: IN PROGRESS - Currently investigating map issue
- **Map Component Investigation**:
  - Map image exists at `/public/assets/step4/Map.png` ✓
  - Z-index layering appears correct in WorldMap.tsx
  - Need to check parent container styling in Operations1Page
- **Next Steps**:
  - Fix map visibility issue
  - Fix color picker (can't create full white, can't save custom colors)

## Current Working Directory
`/Users/jos/Developer/Feadship/config-design-flow-73-main`

## TODO List Status

```
[x] Fix Design Page - Ensure preferences save to yacht config
[x] Fix Operations Pages - Save WHO/WHAT/WHERE selections  
[x] Fix Paint Page - Verify color selections persist
[x] Fix Features/Services/Sustainability - Confirm selections save
[x] Fix card displays with correct library filters
[~] Restore missing UI elements (maps, color pickers) - IN PROGRESS
[ ] Implement direct update pattern throughout (LOW PRIORITY)
```

## Known Issues to Address

### High Priority 🔴
1. **Operating Profile - Missing MAP** - Currently investigating
2. **Paint - Custom Color Wheel** 
   - Cannot create full white color (lightness limited to 50%)
   - Cannot save custom colors properly
3. **Paint - Yacht Parts Color Sync**
   - Colors not syncing when clicking yacht parts
   - Case sensitivity issues with "bootstripe"
4. **Summary Page - General Functionality**
   - Not matching designer's vision
   - Data flow issues from yacht store

### Medium Priority ⚠️
1. General Menu - Font size (second row should be smaller)
2. Features - Small popup dialog
3. Extension - Performance issues

## Key Findings

1. **Direct Update Pattern**: Most components already implement immediate updates to yacht config
2. **Data Persistence**: localStorage integration working correctly through yachtService
3. **Navigation State**: Properly managed through yacht config (active_level_1/2/3)
4. **V2 Architecture**: 
   - Preferences for design, operations, activities
   - Configs for features, services, sustainability
   - Paint data stored in yacht.paint object

## Next Immediate Steps

1. **Fix Map Visibility**:
   - Check parent container height/overflow in Operations1Page
   - Verify ViewMap wrapper doesn't constrain height
   - Test z-index conflicts with NavigationBar

2. **Fix Color Picker**:
   - Investigate ColorPicker.tsx lightness calculation
   - Fix custom color saving to yacht.custom_colors
   - Ensure color picker modal displays properly

3. **Test Everything**:
   - Verify all data persists after page refresh
   - Test navigation flow from start to finish
   - Check responsive behavior on different screen sizes

## Code Quality Notes

- TypeScript compilation passing with no errors
- NavigationBar successfully added to all configuration pages
- Consistent layout pattern established (flex container with NavigationBar at top)
- StandardFeatureCard provides unified design across Features/Services/Sustainability

## Session Recovery Instructions

When resuming work:
1. Continue investigating map visibility issue in Operations1Page
2. Check if map container has proper height/overflow settings
3. Move on to ColorPicker fixes after map is resolved
4. Test all changes in browser with dev tools open
